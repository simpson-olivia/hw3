        <p>Welcome! My name is Olivia Simpson (she/her) and I am a fourth year studying Politics, Philosophy, and Economics student, with a minor in Data Science. After graduation, I plan on pursuing a career in Public Policy Economic research, with a focus on housing policy. I am hoping the skills I have picked up through my data science classes will equip me to perform well in the field. I am originally from Cincinnati, OH and I am known for having a lot of different types of hobbies – I even have an Instagram account dedicated to everything I do. In the next page I will go into more detail about a couple. For some examples: I have my own radio show where I DJ. I am big into baking, crocheting, reading, and painting. I am a big movie watcher, I occasionally go on runs, and I love a long hike. The Moral of the story is that I like to stay busy and I typically have an opinion on everything. I would like to say I’m good at most of these things, but you will have to check out the next page to see for yourself. For my representative photo, I chose a more-silly photo of me when I was studying abroad in South Africa. While there, I researched the country’s HIV and housing policies. </p>
