            <p>As mentioned, I really enjoy being creative! Above is a scarf I made for my dad of our weiner dog, Minnie. It took me almost 2 months to make and I chose it as my feature photo because I think it is (1) very well done and (2) it showcases how my hobbies can be used to tell the people I love how much they mean to me. Crocheting is a hobby I picked up during quarantine, and throughout the past 5 years, I’ve made everything from scarfs to hats to blankets to bookmarks. It is not super complicated to learn and I would recommend picking it up for anyone who is looking to be more creative. Below I will discuss my top 3 hobbies and how often I utilize them. As discussed, there are a lot of hobbies I left out that I just don’t do as frequently. I wanted to spend this time highlighting my more creative ones. To deal with different stresses or anxieties, I like to lean into creative outlets. I have found that running or spending time with friends can also help with anxiety, but being creative is a sure fire way to calm your mind. I always reccomend creative outlets and hobbies to my friends because I also believe it makes your life more colorful and fun. Without further ado, below are my top hobbies. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Crocheting: I crochet almost everyday and I have learned it is something I can do while I watch a movie (one of my other favorite things to do).</li>
                <li>Baking: I've been baking since I could walk and throughout the years I've focused on different types of baked goods. Currently, I bake a couple times a month, mostly focusing on cookies or cakes.</li>
                <li>Painting: My parents have always encouraged me to be artistically creative so I try to draw or paint once a week. I typically draw more because it is more accessible but I would like to start painting more.</li>
